## About

A frontend which uses MerriamWebster API to verify if a combination of letters is a valid word. For use in the game, Quiddler.

## Motivation

While playing Quiddler with my family, it occurred to me that something like this would be a simple, handy tool for checking if words were valid, rather than having to Google and then sift through the results.

## Demo

![Here is a link to my deployment!](https://adb-truthy-words.herokuapp.com/)

--Screenshots and GIF will be added shortly--

## Requirements

* An `env` file in `server` with a Merriam-Webster API key assigned to `DICT_API_KEY`

## ChangeLog

### Future Features:
	* MakeWords: type in letters, list valid words from that
